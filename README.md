# Final Project - MSFR App (Man's Search For Reading)

- A Custom Web Application

This is the sixteenth and final project in the Software Engineer Bootcamp offered by TripleTen. The project showcases the full extent of learning and training undergone in the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The frontend is fully functioning, allowing mock Registration, Sign In and Sign Out, as well as two fully functioning pages: Main and Library.

The Main, or the landing page, explains to the User the purpose of Man's Search For Reading, hopefully stirring in him the desire to be part of something bigger than himself through the pastime of reading in fraternity and seek out the true, good, and beautiful.

The Front-end of the application was written using React.

Currently, there is no Back-end.
